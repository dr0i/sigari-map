# Usage of map
* Zoom as always
* Note the ruler icon beneath the zooming icons: activate it, click on the map once and again at another point: the distance between these points is calculated in km and horse travelling time.
* Hover over a marker and see the top left image change to reflect the graphic associated with the marker. Also, the image has a title and a link to the diaries with the according search phrase for the thing depicted at the image.
